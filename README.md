# Toolbox

Container based development toolbox.

## DO

- Create links from local directory to container directory for caches (gradle, maven, go packages, etc)

## Warning

This is a very personal collection of tools and scripts. 
Things that can change and disappear:

- Collections of tools
- Collections of containers
- Collections of CLI
- Dependency list
- Base image
- ...

It also uses `hjwalt` in multiple places, replace it accordingly.
